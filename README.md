## About
- This fork is my (Guy Lundvall, aka Drakynfly) customized version of ALSV4_CPP by dyanikoglu that adds features that I need for my project, and feel that I should leave here for anyone else who needs it, since I've gotten so much out of this plugin. 


## WARNING
This is provided to give back to the community as is, since I have got so much use out of it. This is under constant and erratic development for my personal project(s), and therefor may be buggy, broken or WIP at any given moment. You have been warned. I suggest using this only to glean inspiration or insight on how to modify/extend ALS.

## Features
- All the features of the original. I generally keep this up-to-date with the latest release.
- Flight support. This is the main point of this fork, and hence the name for it: Faerie ALS.
- Swimming support planned. (Currently the framework is added but no animations)
- Integration with other gameplay systems: Movement adjusts to world temperature (e.g, a weather system), and player weight (e.g. an inventory system).
- Extra mantling features: Auto-mantling over short obstacles without needed input.
- Easier project integration/configuration: there is no need to modify config files in this fork. See #Setting Up The Plugin.

## Known Issues
- No animations for flying and swimming right now, just the framework.

## Setting Up The Plugin
- Clone the repository inside your project's `Plugins` folder, or download the latest release and extract it into your project's or engine's `Plugins` folder.
- Launch the project, and enable plugin content viewer as seen below. This will show contents of the plugin in your content browser:

- This fork removes the need for any config file changes. There are now settings availible in Project Settings menu. Setup Axis inputs, trace channels, collision profiles, and more.

- This fork seperates the functionality for controlling ALSBaseCharacter into a child class: ALSPlayerCharacter. Parent player controlled characters to this class for access to the rest of the input functions (which are renamed to all begin with "Input_").
